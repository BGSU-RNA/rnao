Ontology evokes a myriad of responses - from eye-rolling to fanatic enthusiasm.

 * Structure: from nucleic acid to atoms - their mereological and positional descriptions

 * Sequence: a simplification for string-based bioinformatic analyses

 * Interactions: base pairing, base stacking

 * ...

Rich descriptions about:
 * The bases in a trans Hoogsteen-Hoogteen base pair will be in parallel strands if they base orientations are anti.
